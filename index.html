      <h3>Cappadocia</h3>
      <img src="cro2p.jpg" alt="Cappadocia">
      <p>Cappadocia is a region located in central Anatolia, Turkey. It is known for its unique and striking landscape, which is characterized by its rocky terrain, underground cities, and hot air balloon rides.</p>
      <p>The region's landscape is the result of volcanic eruptions that occurred millions of years ago. These eruptions left behind layers of ash and tuff, which have since been shaped by wind and water erosion. The result is a series of rocky formations known as "fairy chimneys," which are cone-shaped rocks with a cap of harder stone on top.</p>
      <p>Cappadocia is also home to a number of underground cities, which were built by the ancient civilizations that lived in the region. These cities were used as places of refuge during times of war or invasion, and were equipped with everything needed for the people to survive for extended periods of time. Some of these underground cities are several levels deep, and could house up to 20,000 people at a time.</p>

      <p>Pamukkale, also known as "Cotton Castle," is a natural site located in Denizli, Turkey. It is known for its stunning white terraces, which are formed by hot springs that flow down the side of a mountain. The terraces are made of travertine, a type of calcium carbonate, and are a unique and beautiful natural feature.</p>
      <p>The hot springs at Pamukkale have been used for therapeutic purposes for centuries. The minerals in the water are believed to have healing properties, and people have been coming to the site to bathe in the springs for over 2,000 years. The ancient city of Hierapolis, which was founded in the 2nd century BC, was built near the springs, and the site was used as a spa for centuries.</p>
      <p>Today, Pamukkale is a popular tourist destination, and visitors can take a dip in the hot springs or walk along the terraces to admire the views. The terraces are best viewed in the early morning or late afternoon, when the sun is low in the sky and the light is softer. The site is also home to a number of ancient ruins, including the Temple of Apollo, the Roman Baths, and the Necropolis, which are all worth exploring.</p>
